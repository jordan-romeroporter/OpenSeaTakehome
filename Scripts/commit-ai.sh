COMMIT_MSG=$(echo "Review this git diff and generate a comprehensive multi-line conventional commit message.

IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS:
1. Start with ONE main conventional commit type (feat/fix/docs/style/refactor/test/chore/perf) that represents the primary change
2. Format: 'type(scope): brief description' for the first line (keep under 72 chars)
3. Leave a blank line after the first line
4. Then provide a detailed body with:
   - A brief paragraph explaining the overall change
   - A bulleted list of ALL individual changes, grouped by type if multiple types exist
   - Each bullet should be specific and mention the file/component affected
   - Use format like: '- feat: added user authentication to login.js'
   - Include ALL changes, even minor ones
5. Be comprehensive - I want to be able to understand what changed without looking at the diff
6. If there are breaking changes, add 'BREAKING CHANGE:' section at the end

$FILES_CHANGED
