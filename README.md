# Portfolio iOS App

Note: I have a Scripts dir, which is more of an example of how I'd scaffold a project. If you are willing to try them out please check out the commit-ai.sh file, this is something I use personally on all projects to expedite creating commits and following consistent conventions. 

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Clone repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jordan-romeroporter/OpenSeaTakehome.git
   cd OpenSeaTakehome
   ```
2. **Run automated setup**
   ```bash
   ./Scripts/setup.sh
   ```
3. **Configure API key**
   ```bash
   echo "ALCHEMY_API_KEY = your_key_here" > Configuration/Secrets.xcconfig
   ```
4. **Open in Xcode**
   ```bash
   open OpenSeaTakehome.xcodeproj
   ```

## 🛠 Developer Tools Setup

### Prerequisites

- Xcode command-line tools
- Claude CLI (`pip install anthropic` or download from Anthropic) with a configured `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`

### Install Command Aliases
Add these aliases to your shell for a better developer experience:

```bash
# Add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc
echo '
# Portfolio App Developer Tools
alias pf-commit="./Scripts/commit-ai.sh"
alias pf-feature="./Scripts/create-feature.sh"
alias pf-audit="./Scripts/accessibility-audit.sh"
alias pf-docs="./Scripts/generate-docs.sh"
alias pf-setup="./Scripts/setup.sh"

# Quick commands
alias pf-test="swift test"
alias pf-build="xcodebuild -scheme Portfolio build"
alias pf-clean="xcodebuild clean"
' >> ~/.zshrc

# Reload shell configuration
source ~/.zshrc
```

### One-Line Installation
```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jordan-romeroporter/OpenSeaTakehome/main/Scripts/install-aliases.sh | bash
```
